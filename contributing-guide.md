## How Can I Contribute?

### Reporting Bugs

This section guides you through submitting a bug report. Following these guidelines helps maintainers and the community understand your report, reproduce the behavior, and find related reports.

Before creating bug reports, please check [this list](#before-submitting-a-bug-report) as you might find out that you don't need to create one. When you are creating a bug report, please [include as many details as possible](#how-do-i-submit-a-good-bug-report).

#### Before Submitting A Bug Report

* **Check the [discussions](https://github.com/[yourusername]/ticket-hero-sdk/discussions)** for a list of common questions and problems.
* **Perform a [cursory search](https://github.com/search?q=+is%3Aissue+repo%3A[yourusername]/ticket-hero-sdk)** to see if the problem has already been reported. If it has **and the issue is still open**, add a comment to the existing issue instead of opening a new one.

#### How Do I Submit A (Good) Bug Report?

Bugs are tracked as [GitHub issues](https://github.com/[yourusername]/ticket-hero-sdk/issues). Create an issue and provide the following information:

* **Use a clear and descriptive title** for the issue to identify the problem.
* **Describe the exact steps which reproduce the problem** in as much detail as possible.
* **Provide specific examples to demonstrate the steps**.
* **Describe the behavior you observed after following the steps** and point out what exactly is the problem with that behavior.
* **Explain which behavior you expected to see instead and why.**
* **Include screenshots and animated GIFs** which show you following the described steps and clearly demonstrate the problem.
* **If the problem wasn't triggered by a specific action**, describe what you were doing before the problem happened and share more information using the guidelines below.

### Suggesting Enhancements

This section guides you through submitting an enhancement suggestion, including completely new features and minor improvements to existing functionality.

#### Before Submitting An Enhancement Suggestion

* **Check if the enhancement has already been suggested** by searching for existing issues.
* **Determine which repository the enhancement should be suggested in** (e.g., core functionality vs documentation).

#### How Do I Submit A (Good) Enhancement Suggestion?

Enhancement suggestions are tracked as [GitHub issues](https://github.com/[yourusername]/ticket-hero-sdk/issues). Create an issue and provide the following information:

* **Use a clear and descriptive title** for the issue to identify the suggestion.
* **Provide a step-by-step description of the suggested enhancement** in as much detail as possible.
* **Provide specific examples to demonstrate the steps**. 
* **Describe the current behavior** and **explain which behavior you expected to see instead** and why.
* **Explain why this enhancement would be useful** to most Ticket Hero SDK users.
* **Specify which version of Ticket Hero SDK you're using.**
* **Specify the name and version of the OS you're using.**

### Your First Code Contribution

Unsure where to begin contributing? You can start by looking through these `beginner` and `help-wanted` issues:

* [Beginner issues](https://github.com/[yourusername]/ticket-hero-sdk/labels/beginner) - issues which should only require a few lines of code, and a test or two.
* [Help wanted issues](https://github.com/[yourusername]/ticket-hero-sdk/labels/help%20wanted) - issues which should be a bit more involved than `beginner` issues.

### Pull Requests

The process described here has several goals:

- Maintain Ticket Hero SDK's quality
- Fix problems that are important to users
- Engage the community in working toward the best possible Ticket Hero SDK
- Enable a sustainable system for maintainers to review contributions
